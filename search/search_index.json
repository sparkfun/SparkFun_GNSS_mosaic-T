The <code>INT</code>/<code>EXT</code> slide switch selects the internal or external oscillator.</p> <p>The mosaic-T is a sophisticated timing receiver running an internal web server that can be accessed through the USB interface with a standard browser using a Linux/Windows computer. Septentrio also provides dozens of video tutorials to guide users through the configuration settings of their GNSS receivers utilizing the web interface.</p> <p>Beyond the capabilities of the mosaic-T module, this board is seamless to operate with no programming skills required. Gone are the times when a microcontroller was required to interface with the GNSS receiver and log data to an SD card and when users had to carry around an SD card reader to extract the data from the SD card. The Timing GNSS Breakout - mosaic-T  can start/stop logging data or mount/unmount the SD card, without a single line of code, just utilizing a simple button. For the users who prefer a command-line interface, Septentrio has you covered. Users can still control and configure the mosaic-T module through a CLI, which is useful for scenarios such as production line testing (in fact, that is how we tested this board).</p> <p>This breakout board is a perfect middle ground for users who would like to integrate the mosaic-T module into a project/enclosure with access to a majority of the module's available pins, similar to Septentrio's developer kit, but in the smaller form factor of their evaluation kit. Or maybe... you just needed a very accurate PPS output at a 3.3V logic level. Please, check out the rest of our hookup guide for more details on the capabilities of this board (that we couldn't fit in this product description).</p> <p>RTK Base</p> <p>The mosaic-T is a superb GNSS module designed for highly accurate timing applications. It can be configured as a RTK Rover and will make use of incoming RTCM corrections. But it can not be configured as a RTK Base. RTCM output is not supported.</p> </li> <p>Important: Read Before Use!</p> <p>ESD Sensitivity</p> <p>The mosaic-T module is sensitive to ESD. Use a proper grounding system to make sure that the working surface and the components are at the same electric potential.</p> ESD Precautions <p>As recommended by the manufacturer, we highly recommend that users take the necessary ESD precautions to avoid damaging their module.</p> <p> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <p>iFixit Anti-Static Wrist Strap TOL-25572</p> <p>Active Antenna</p> <p>Never inject an external DC voltage into the SMA connector for the GNSS antenna, as it may damage the mosaic-T module. For instance, when using a splitter to distribute the antenna signal to several GNSS receivers, make sure that no more than one output of the splitter passes DC. Use DC-blocks otherwise.</p> Product Comparison <p>Below is a simple comparison table between our breakout board and Septentrio's development and evaluation kits:</p> <p>      mosaic-T Development Kit      mosaic-T GNSS Breakout      GNSS Disciplined Oscillator GNSS Antenna Dual Single Single USB Connector micro-B Type-C Type-C Ethernet          Yes 10/100 Base-T No          Yes 10/100 Base-T WiFi No No          Yes - Network Bridge 10 Base-T COM Ports 4 4          1 - mosaic-T         1 - ESP32      \u00b5SD Card Slot Yes Yes Yes Reset/Log Buttons Yes Yes Yes Logic-Level          1.8V         3.3V      3.3V          3.3V         5V      PPS Signal Header Pin PTH Pad SMA Connector External Ref.
